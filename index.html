          <p>Influential DJs the Hot Mix 5 were honored with a sign at Columbus Drive and Balbo Avenue in 2007. The crew rose to prominence with vise-tight sets on WBMX-FM that incorporated everything from the latest from local label Trax Records to Bon
            Jovi’s “You Give Love a Bad Name.”</p>

          <p>To celebrate the Hot Mix 5’s 30th anniversary, nickname-loving members Farley “Jackmaster” Funk, Kenny “Jammin” Jason, Mickey “Mixin” Oliver, Ralphi “the Razz” Rosario and Julian “Jumpin” Perez (who replaced Scott “Smokin’” Silz) reunited on
            Friday 14, 2007 at the Mid(306 N Halsted St). Event producer Sam Cappas, a close confidant of the Hot Mix 5, tells me that group members will get individual honorary streets dedicated to them in 2012, substantiating his story with photos of
            “Kenny Jammin Jason Blvd” and “Mickey Mixin Oliver Blvd” signs.</p>
